# CITM's Racing Game: NP CUP 
We are a group of three students from CITM's degree on videogames design & development.<br>
This time we've been asked to code the core for a Racing Game using Bullet, OpenGL and SDL libraries. We've made a level of a racing game which uses gravitational changes through the map.<br>

## Team members
* Miquel Suau González: https://github.com/MayKoder/
* Eudald Garrofé Flix: https://github.com/Hevne
* Jordi Pardo Gutiérrez: https://github.com/Jordi-Pardo

## Controls

* WASD: Move car

## Goal

The main goal is to get to the end of the map while activating all the checkpoints, but be careful, if you fall off the map, you will be sent to the last checkpoint. You will need to think ahead of the gravity changes, because they can 'flip' your mind.<br>

## Debug Controls

* F1: Debug Mode to see sensors.
* F2: Last Checkpoint.
* F3: Kill and respawn from start
* F4: Camera unfollows/follows car position
* Arrow keys while camera isn't following car: Move camerafreely through the map.
* R F while camera isn't following car: Up/down camera 

## Guide to finish the game

The game is really straight forward, follow the circuit and you will get to the end, think ahead before rushing into a gravity change.<br>
