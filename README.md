# CITM's Racing Game: NP CUP 
We are a group of three students from CITM's degree on videogames design & development.<br>
This time we've been asked to code the core for a Racing Game using Bullet, OpenGL and SDL libraries. We've made a level of a racing game which uses gravitational changes through the map.<br>
